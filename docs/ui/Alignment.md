# Alignment

A type that defines layout alignment options for 
positioning UI elements within a container.

```c++
enum class Alignment;
```

This is commonly used in rendering or layout systems to define 
how a component should be placed relative to its parent or 
bounding region.

**Fields:**
- `Leading`: Align to the leading edge, left, or top, depending on the orientation.
- `Trailing`: Align to the trailing edge, right, or bottom, depending on the orientation.
- `Center`: Align to the center.
- `Top`: Align to the top edge.
- `Bottom`: Align to the bottom edge.
- `None`: No alignment specified or default fallback.
